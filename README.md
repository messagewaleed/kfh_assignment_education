# kfh_assignment_education

A Spring boot application for Students/Courses Rest API

I have used concepts such as Spring Security, JWT Authorization, Swagger, Caching, Developer tools, Profiles in this application

You can run it through an IDE like STS or Intellij or through maven:

1. Build the project using mvn clean install
2. Run using mvn spring-boot:run
3. The web application is accessible via localhost:8087
4. Use username and password as 'user' to login

I have also included the database .sql file
